This is a sample text file for testing the embedding API.
It contains multiple lines of text that will be processed and converted into vector embeddings.
The embedding API supports both text and PDF files for synchronous processing.
For larger files, it supports asynchronous job processing with webhooks.
This is useful for batch processing of documents in production environments.
